# Tokenomics

The BEP-007 standard implements a comprehensive tokenomics model that supports both simple and learning agents while aligning incentives across the ecosystem to ensure the protocol's long-term sustainability and growth.

## Core Protocol Fee Structure

The protocol implements a standardized fee structure based on the BEP007Treasury contract:

### 1. Protocol Minting Fee

**Fixed Protocol Minting Fee**: 0.01 BNB per agent minted (applies to all BEP-007 agents)
- Automatically collected by the BEP007Treasury contract
- Distributed across three ecosystem entities:
  - **60% → NFA/ChatAndBuild Foundation** (for ongoing R&D + grants)
  - **25% → Community Treasury** (for ecosystem growth initiatives)
  - **15% → $NFA Staking Reward Pool** (to reward long-term token holders)

This structure ensures that every BEP-007 agent minted generates protocol revenue for the ecosystem, creating sustainable funding for development and rewarding stakeholders.

### 2. Agent Creation Process

**Standard Agent Creation**:
- Protocol minting fee: 0.01 BNB (collected by treasury)
- Gas costs for contract deployment and initialization
- Optional metadata storage costs

**Enhanced Agent Creation** (with learning capabilities):
- Protocol minting fee: 0.01 BNB (collected by treasury)
- Additional gas costs for learning module setup
- Optional learning tree initialization

### 3. Agent Operation Fees

**Basic Operations**:
- Agent funding: User-controlled (for gas and operations)
- Logic updates: Gas costs only
- Metadata updates: Gas costs only

**Learning Operations** (Enhanced agents only):
- Learning tree updates: Gas costs for Merkle root updates
- Interaction recording: Gas costs for state updates
- Cross-agent learning: Gas costs for federated operations

## Treasury Management and Distribution

The BEP007Treasury contract provides automated fee collection and distribution:

### 1. Automatic Fee Distribution

```solidity
// Distribution percentages (fixed in contract)
uint256 public constant FOUNDATION_PERCENTAGE = 6000;  // 60%
uint256 public constant TREASURY_PERCENTAGE = 2500;    // 25%
uint256 public constant STAKING_PERCENTAGE = 1500;     // 15%
```

**Real-time Distribution**:
- Fees are distributed immediately upon collection (when distribution is not paused)
- Transparent on-chain tracking of all distributions
- Emergency controls for pausing collection or distribution

### 2. Treasury Allocation Structure

**Foundation Allocation (60%)**:
- Protocol development and maintenance
- Research and development initiatives
- Security audits and infrastructure
- Developer grants and ecosystem support

**Community Treasury (25%)**:
- Ecosystem growth initiatives
- Partnership development
- Marketing and adoption programs
- Community incentives and rewards

**Staking Rewards (15%)**:
- $NFA token holder rewards
- Long-term holder incentives
- Governance participation rewards
- Liquidity provision incentives

### 3. Emergency Controls

**Circuit Breaker Mechanisms**:
- Global pause functionality for emergency situations
- Separate controls for fee collection and distribution
- Governance-controlled emergency fund withdrawal
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations

## Enhanced Learning Agent Economics

### 1. Learning Module Integration

**Learning Enablement**:
- Optional upgrade from standard to learning agent
- Learning module registration and verification
- Merkle tree-based learning state management

    // ... standard fields
    bool learningEnabled;     // Whether learning is enabled
    address learningModule;   // Learning module contract address
    bytes32 learningTreeRoot; // Merkle root of learning tree
    uint256 learningVersion;  // Learning implementation version
}
```

### 2. Learning-Based Value Creation

### 1. Governance Token Integration

**Voting Power Calculation**:
- 1 BEP-007 token = 1 vote
- Proposal creation requirements
- Quorum thresholds for proposal execution
- Time-locked execution for security

**Governance Parameters**:
```solidity
uint256 public votingPeriod;      // Voting duration in days
uint256 public quorumPercentage;  // Required participation percentage
uint256 public executionDelay;    // Delay before execution in days
```
