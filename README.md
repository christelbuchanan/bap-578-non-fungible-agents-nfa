# BEP-007: Non-Fungible Agent (NFA) Token Standard

![BEP-007 Non-Fungible Agents](https://github.com/christelbuchanan/bep007-non-fungible-agents-nfa/blob/e72d12896ae8a2afced541c962011801a144dbdf/Frame%2010.png)

## Overview

BEP-007 introduces Non-Fungible Agents (NFAs)—programmable, autonomous tokens that act as on-chain "agents" capable of executing tasks, evolving, and interacting with other contracts. Inspired by the iconic "007" designation for elite agents, this standard merges the uniqueness of NFTs with autonomous functionality, positioning BNB Chain as the home for decentralized automation.

This implementation provides a complete framework for creating, managing, and governing autonomous agent tokens on the BNB Chain with **optional learning capabilities** that allow agents to evolve and improve over time.

## 🚀 Enhanced Learning Capabilities

BEP-007 now offers **two development paths** to accommodate different use cases and developer preferences:

### **Path 1: JSON Light Memory (Default)**
Perfect for most developers and immediate deployment:
- ✅ **Simple**: Familiar JSON metadata approach (like standard NFTs)
- ✅ **Fast**: Deploy agents immediately with no complexity
- ✅ **Compatible**: Works with all existing NFT infrastructure
- ✅ **Cost-effective**: Minimal gas costs for basic operations

### **Path 2: Merkle Tree Learning (Optional)**
For advanced developers wanting truly evolving agents:
- 🧠 **Evolving**: Agents that genuinely learn and improve over time
- 🔒 **Provable**: Cryptographically verifiable learning history
- ⚡ **Efficient**: Only 32-byte Merkle roots stored on-chain
- 🚀 **Advanced**: Cutting-edge AI agent capabilities from day 1

### **Key Benefits**
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing agents continue working unchanged
- **Optional Adoption**: Choose your complexity level
- **Upgrade Path**: Simple agents can enable learning later
- **Gas Optimized**: Learning data stored off-chain with on-chain verification
- **Future-Proof**: Architecture supports advanced AI developments

## Why a Token Standard?

### The Need for Standardization

While traditional NFTs (BEP-721) provide uniqueness and ownership, they lack the standardized interfaces needed for autonomous behavior and cross-platform agent interactions. BEP-007 addresses this gap by defining:

1. **Consistent Agent Interfaces**: Standardized methods for action execution, state management, and logic upgrades that enable predictable interactions across platforms.

2. **Interoperability Framework**: Common patterns for how agents interact with other contracts, services, and each other, creating an ecosystem where agents from different developers can work together.

3. **Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain Architecture**: Clear separation between on-chain identity and permissions versus off-chain extended memory and complex behaviors, optimizing for both gas efficiency and rich functionality.

4. **Optional Learning System**: Standardized interfaces for agent learning and evolution, allowing developers to choose between simple static agents or sophisticated learning agents.

5. **Security Boundaries**: Standardized circuit breaker patterns, permission systems, and access controls that protect users and their assets.

### On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Components

BEP-007 carefully balances which components belong on-chain versus off-chain:

| Component | Storage | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Agent Identity | On-chain | Core identity must be immutable and universally accessible |
| Ownership & Permissions | On-chain | Security and access control require consensus verification |
| Basic Metadata | On-chain | Essential for marketplace display and basic interactions |
| Logic Address | On-chain | Determines how the agent behaves when actions are executed |
| Learning Tree Root | On-chain | Cryptographic proof of learning state (32 bytes only) |
| Extended Memory | Off-chain (with hash verification) | Rich memory would be prohibitively expensive on-chain |
| Learning Tree Data | Off-chain (with Merkle verification) | Detailed learning data with cryptographic integrity |
| Complex Behaviors | Off-chain | Advanced AI behaviors require off-chain computation |
| Voice/Animation | Off-chain (with URI reference) | Media assets are too large for on-chain storage |

This hybrid approach ensures that:
- Critical security and identity information is secured by blockchain consensus
- Gas costs remain reasonable for agent operations
- Rich agent experiences can evolve without blockchain limitations
- Learning capabilities are cryptographically verifiable yet cost-efficient

### Ecosystem Benefits

Standardization through BEP-007 enables:

1. **Developer Ecosystem**: Common interfaces allow developers to build agent-compatible applications without custom integration for each agent implementation.

2. **Marketplace Integration**: Platforms can display, trade, and interact with agents using standardized methods, regardless of the agent's specific purpose or learning capabilities.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Agents can move between applications while maintaining their identity, memory, and learned behaviors.

4. **User Ownership**: Clear separation of on-chain and off-chain components ensures users maintain control of their agents' data and behavior.

5. **Innovation Acceleration**: Developers can focus on creating unique agent behaviors rather than reinventing infrastructure patterns.

6. **Learning Portability**: Agents with learning enabled can carry their knowledge and experience across different platforms and applications.

## Usage

### Creating a Simple Agent (JSON Light Memory)

To create a traditional agent with static metadata:

```javascript
// Use the simple createAgent function - learning disabled by default
const tx = await agentFactory.createAgent(
  "My Simple Agent",
  "MSA",
  logicAddress,
  "ipfs://metadata-uri"
);

const receipt = await tx.wait();
const agentCreatedEvent = receipt.events.find(e => e.event === "AgentCreated");
const agentAddress = agentCreatedEvent.args.agent;

console.log(`✅ Simple agent created at: ${agentAddress}`);
```

### Creating a Learning Agent from Day 1

To create an agent with learning capabilities enabled from the start:

```javascript
// 1. Create initial learning tree
const initialLearningData = {
  preferences: { indentation: "2-spaces", naming: "camelCase" },
  patterns: ["functional", "modular"],
  confidence: 0.1
};

const learningTree = createLearningTree(initialLearningData);
const initialRoot = ethers.utils.keccak256(
  ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(learningTree.branches))
);

// 2. Create enhanced metadata with learning enabled
const enhancedMetadata = {
  persona: JSON.stringify({
    traits: ["analytical", "helpful", "adaptive"],
    style: "professional",
    tone: "friendly"
  }),
  memory: "AI coding assistant specialized in blockchain development",
  voiceHash: "bafkreigh2akiscaild...",
  animationURI: "ipfs://Qm.../agent_avatar.mp4",
  vaultURI: "ipfs://Qm.../agent_vault.json",
  vaultHash: ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes("vault_content")),
  // Learning fields
  learningEnabled: true,
  learningModule: merkleTreeLearning.address,
  learningTreeRoot: initialRoot,
  learningVersion: 1
};

// 3. Create the agent with enhanced metadata
const tx = await agentFactory.createAgent(
  "My Learning Agent",
  "MLA",
  logicAddress,
  "ipfs://metadata-uri",
  enhancedMetadata
);

console.log(`🧠 Learning agent created with evolving capabilities`);
```

### Upgrading Existing Agent to Learning

To enable learning on an existing simple agent:

```javascript
// Create initial learning tree
const learningTree = createLearningTree({ tokenId });
const initialRoot = ethers.utils.keccak256(
  ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(learningTree.branches))
);

// Enable learning on existing agent
const tx = await bep007Enhanced.enableLearning(
  tokenId,
  merkleTreeLearning.address,
  initialRoot
);

await tx.wait();
console.log(`🔄 Learning enabled for existing agent`);
```

### Recording Learning Interactions

To record interactions that help the agent learn:

```javascript
// Record successful interaction
await bep007Enhanced.recordInteraction(
  tokenId,
  "code_generation",
  true // success
);

// Record failed interaction
await bep007Enhanced.recordInteraction(
  tokenId,
  "bug_fixing", 
  false // failure
);

console.log(`📊 Interactions recorded for learning`);
```

### Checking Learning Progress

To view an agent's learning metrics:

```javascript
const { enabled, moduleAddress, metrics } = await bep007Enhanced.getLearningInfo(tokenId);

if (enabled) {
  console.log(`🧠 Learning Module: ${moduleAddress}`);
  console.log(`📊 Total Interactions: ${metrics.totalInteractions}`);
  console.log(`🎯 Learning Events: ${metrics.learningEvents}`);
  console.log(`⚡ Learning Velocity: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(metrics.learningVelocity, 18)}`);
  console.log(`🎖️ Confidence Score: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(metrics.confidenceScore, 18)}`);
} else {
  console.log("📚 Agent using JSON light memory (learning disabled)");
}
```

### Executing Agent Actions

To execute an action with your agent (works for both simple and learning agents):

```javascript
// Encode the function call
const data = agentLogic.interface.encodeFunctionData("performTask", [
  param1,
  param2,
  param3
]);

// Execute the action
await agent.executeAction(data);

// For learning agents, interactions are automatically recorded
```

### Upgrading Agent Logic

To upgrade an agent's logic (works for both simple and learning agents):

```javascript
// Deploy new logic
const NewAgentLogic = await ethers.getContractFactory("NewAgentLogic");
const newAgentLogic = await NewAgentLogic.deploy();
await newAgentLogic.deployed();

// Update the agent's logic
await agent.setLogicAddress(newAgentLogic.address);
```

### Working with Memory Modules

To register a memory module:

```javascript
// Create module metadata
const moduleMetadata = JSON.stringify({
  context_id: "nfa007-memory-001",
  owner: ownerAddress,
  created: new Date().toISOString(),
  persona: "Strategic crypto analyst"
});

// Sign the registration
const messageHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "address", "string"],
  [tokenId, moduleAddress, moduleMetadata]
);
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(messageHash));

// Register the module
await memoryRegistry.registerModule(
  tokenId,
  moduleAddress,
  moduleMetadata,
  signature
);
```

### Managing Vault Permissions

To delegate vault access:

```javascript
// Set expiry time (1 day from now)
const expiryTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400;

// Sign the delegation
const messageHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "address", "uint256"],
  [tokenId, delegateAddress, expiryTime]
);
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(messageHash));

// Delegate access
await vaultManager.delegateAccess(
  tokenId,
  delegateAddress,
  expiryTime,
  signature
);
```

## Learning System Deep Dive

### Learning Tree Structure

Learning data is stored off-chain in a structured format with cryptographic verification:

```json
{
  "root": "0x...", // Merkle root (stored on-chain)
  "branches": {
    "codingStyle": {
      "indentation": "2-spaces",
      "naming": "camelCase",
      "patterns": ["functional", "modular"],
      "confidence": 0.85
    },
    "userPreferences": {
      "frameworks": ["React", "Vue"],
      "languages": ["TypeScript", "Solidity"],
      "testingStyle": "jest-focused"
    },
    "interactions": {
      "totalSessions": 47,
      "avgSessionLength": "23min",
      "successfulTasks": 89,
      "learningVelocity": 0.12
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
    "agentId": 123
  }
}
```

### Learning Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive learning metrics:

- **Total Interactions**: Number of user interactions
- **Learning Events**: Significant learning updates
- **Learning Velocity**: Rate of learning (events per day)
- **Confidence Score**: Overall agent confidence (0-1)
- **Milestones**: Achievement markers (100 interactions, 80% confidence, etc.)

### Security Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 50 learning updates per day per agent
- **Access Control**: Only agent owners can update learning
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All learning claims require Merkle proofs
- **Tamper-Proof History**: Learning history cannot be falsified

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Enhanced metadata structure with learning flags
- Basic Merkle tree learning implementation
- Full backward compatibility maintained

### Phase 2: Advanced Learning (3-6 months)
- Specialized learning modules for different domains
- Cross-agent learning networks
- Learning marketplaces and reputation systems

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Evolution (6-12 months)
- Agent intelligence valuations
- Decentralized learning protocols
- AI agent collaboration networks

## Security Considerations

- **Circuit Breaker**: The protocol includes a dual-layer pause mechanism:
  - Global pause for system-wide emergencies
  - Contract-specific pauses for targeted intervention
  - Controlled by both governance and emergency multi-sig for rapid response
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All fund-handling functions are protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Gas Limits**: Delegatecall operations have gas limits to prevent out-of-gas attacks
- **Access Control**: Strict access control for sensitive operations
- **Balance Management**: Agents maintain their own balance for gas fees
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Signature-based verification for memory module registration and vault access
- **Time-based Permissions**: Delegated vault access with expiry times
- **Learning Security**: Rate limiting, access control, and cryptographic verification for all learning operations
